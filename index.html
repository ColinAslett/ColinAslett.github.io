<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size: 32px"> Introduction </h2>

<p style = "text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px"> Hello! I am a Computer Science major who is pursuing a career in software design.
I have used several programming languages to create software for school, work and personal projects.
In college, I was a varsity athlete and I still follow a disciplined strength and conditioning routine.
My interest in sports has created a passion for writing sports analytics software.
In my spare time, I also like to analyze no-limit hold'em poker games vs. game theory optimization.
<br/> <br/>
This website gives examples of the type of results my NCAA Division 1 football rating system generates.
As described in the readme file for the program in the repository, my program
reads the results of each NCCA Division 1 college football match during the season from
<a href="https://collegefootballdata.com/"> collegefootballdata.com</a> and provides a rating and relative
ranking of each team using five different rating systems. The information below provides a brief comparison of the ratings systems,
an example of the results after the final week of the 2021 season, and an example of the forecasted win % for upcoming games using MLR.
The final section is work in progress and will compare the relative performance of each system as more data is obtained.

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size: 32px"> A Brief Comparison of the Rating Systems Used </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px"> <strong>Elo: </strong>
The Elo rating system is well known for its use in chess. Elo uses the existing rating of the competitors
and the result of the match to determine each competitor's new Elo rating. The Elo rating for each team starts
at 1500 at the beginning of the season with a global K-value of 80-100.
A more detailed description of the Elo rating system can be found here:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"> Elo Details </a> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  <strong>Glicko 2: </strong>
The Glicko 2 rating system is similar to the Elo system.  The difference is mostly the inclusion of a ratings deviation
that gives an indication of the reliability of the rating.
The rating deviation for each team starts at 350 but, as more games are played, Glicko 2 gets more confident and it will decrease.
A more detailed description of this rating system can be found here:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system"> Glicko 2 Details </a> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  <strong>HITS: </strong>
Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) was originally designed as a link analysis algorithm that rates web pages. I have modified the algorithm
to rate college football teams.
A more detailed description of this rating system can be found here:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm"> HITS Details </a> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  <strong>PageRank: </strong>
PageRank was originally developed by Google to rank websites but can be applied to sports as well. As shown in Table 1, it is a graph-based
rating system and the rating of a team is affected by how the strength of
their opponents continue to evolve over the course of the season after they have played them.
A more detailed description of this rating system can be found here:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank"> PageRank Details </a> </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  <strong>BG </strong>
BG is my interpretation of the BeatGraph system. As shown in Table 1, this is also a graph based rating system. BeatGraph is the only rating system
I use that purposefully destroys part of the game data in an attempt to create a acyclic graph. In college football this generally results in about 30-40%
of game data being thrown away. A more detailed description of this rating system can be found here:

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size: 32px"> An Example using the 2020-2021 Season </h2>

        <!-- College Football-->
        <div class="class1">

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  
Table 2 shows the results obtained at the conclusion of the 2020/2021 college footbal regular season based on all of the games played to that point.
The results for each rating system are listed in their rank order and shown next to each other to make it easy to see the differences.
The final ranking from the BCS committee is also shown for reference.
The program generates a rating for all college Div. 1 football teams but only the top 25 for each system are shown in Table 2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size: 16px;margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px"> <b> Notes: </b> In 2020/2021, with Covid-19 forcing many conferences to
only play against teams within the conference, the graph-based rating systems suffered. Alabama had a perfect score in the SEC but was ranked lower
than other teams that simply played teams outside of their conference. Another challenge for the rating systems in the 2020/2021 season was that many
teams did not play the same number of games, which is crucial when the regular season is only about a dozen games to begin with.  </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size: 32px"> Applying MLR to Predict Game Results </h2>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin-left: 50px;margin-right:50px">  <strong> Win Probabilities using MLR: </strong>
In addition to providing the relative ranking of college football teams, I will also provide the win probabilities for upcoming games using the
Multiple Linear Regression(MLR) formula. As shown in Table 3, MLR will use the scores of the past games and game data (like yards per game) to determine the win probabilities
of a team in a future match. Table 4 shows an example of how I will record the percentage odds of a given team winning their match starting in the 2021/2022 season.
The table will be updated weekly before the games begin once the college season begins.
